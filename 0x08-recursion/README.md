# functionC - Recursion

![Meme about recursion functions](https://media.makeameme.org/created/to-understand-recursion.jpg)

- Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way
- If a program allows you to call a function inside the same function
- Then it is called a recursive call of the function
- Define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop
